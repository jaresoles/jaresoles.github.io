title: An update!

Let me address the elephant in the room that despite its humungous size is very unlikely to get cancer. I cannot believe that it took me a year before I finally made a new post. I have been holding my head too low that I sincerely have very little recollection of many improtant things that have changed and happened right before me. And one cannot chronicle what they do not see and live...or think deeply about, at least in my case, who find writing as an all-consuming activity, that it even depletes the little amount of patience and sociability that I have. While the world is far from not being such a sad sight, Im lucky to have a POV that's slowly and carefully recalibrating to be a little less grim (which honestly seemed like outside of my control) that's helping me to write again. The world is starting to look prettier with all shades of blue becoming brighter, and yellow becoming warmer on the skin, and green becoming livelier than they used to look.

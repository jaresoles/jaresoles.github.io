I need to start working on this manuscript. I have already gathered sufficient data from a bunch of analyses that ran an unnecessarily extensive bioinformatic gamut. But what these analyses and inferences lack are validation. Yes, I have done my due diligence in spending hours perusing related literature and getting my hands dirty with several bioinformatic tools. And I am confident with the way I collected my data - I did my analyses the way I would do my wet lab experiments: several controls, benchmarking and a few repetitions. And yet, I still hadn't quite hit the mark - are conclusions supposed to still sound speculative-ish?

I put up this snip of a PAGE gel simply because I have an unhealthy skepticism of anything electrophoresis-related technique. I know - is there medication for this kind of paranoia?

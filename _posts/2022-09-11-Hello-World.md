Motivation for this blog. 

I have always wanted to have my own blogsite but I could never commit to maintaining one. I've tried setting up in at least three (3) blog-hosting domains already with no success- I just couldn't muster enough patience to deal with all the nitty gritty from conceptualization of a cohesive theme to the visual aspects of it. Yet here I am, still quite impatient,  but with just enough nonchalance to actually go through with this. It is a bit overdue, really. I've put up the same New Year's Eve goal for a handful of years already. But this feels nice - creating my first text, in my own blog. But I digress.

My reason for creating a blog is simple: I want to blog for the sake of blogging. Tautological but it is what it is (:P). But to be very honest, I am strongly impelled to leave something behind and to let the world know of every little thought and ideas on all things weird in life and in science. And I tend to tire really quickly if I have to speak for long periods of time so I thought blogging would be the way to share my ideas and reflections. But be warned: I do not have a lot of gold ideas- my writing is rusty, my ideas are rough around the edges, and I, generally, just need a bit of sharpening up. And I am reallyy hopeful that blogging (and publishing publicly) would help me by holding me accountable for the quality of my thoughts and they way I communicate. I wish that my writing can contribute to the re-ignition of people's childlike curiosity. Afterall, life is such an astounding feat of physical and chemical interactions. 

Anyway, this has gone on too long. But my intentions and motivations should be clear enough. I apologize for the layout - I am still really new to this. I will work really hard to work on this project.

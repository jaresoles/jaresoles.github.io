Motivation for this blog. 

<p align="justify">
I have always wanted to have my own blogsite but I could never commit to maintaining one. I've tried setting up in at least three (3) blog-hosting domains already with no success- I just couldn't muster enough patience to deal with all the nitty gritty from conceptualization of a cohesive theme to the visual aspects of it. Yet here I am, still quite impatient,  but with just enough nonchalance to actually go through with this. It is a bit overdue, really. I've put up the same New Year's Eve goal for a handful of years already. But this feels nice - creating my first text, in my own blog. But I digress.

My reason for creating a blog is simple: I want to blog for the sake of blogging. Tautological but it is what it is. In all seriousness, I am strongly impelled to leave something behind and to let the world know of every little thought and idea I have of all weird things in life and in science. And I tend to tire really quickly if I have to speak for long periods of time so I thought blogging would be the way to share my ideas and reflections. But now is as good a time as any to warn you: my writing is rusty, my ideas are rough around the edges, and I still need a bit of sharpening up. And I am really hopeful that blogging (and publishing publicly) would help by holding me accountable for the quality of my thoughts and the way I communicate. I wish that my writing can give sense of some of your curiosities and can actually inspire a few questions or two. Afterall, life is such an astounding feature of the universe - and you just can't not be intrigued by the stems and gears that drive it.

Anyway, this is becoming too long for an intro. But my intentions and motivations should be clear enough. I apologize for the layout - I am still really new to this. I will work really hard on this project.

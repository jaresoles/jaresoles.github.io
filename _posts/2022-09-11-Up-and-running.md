Motivation for this blog. 

<p align="justify">
I have always wanted to have my own blogsite but I could never commit to maintaining one. I've tried to set up a website on at least three (3) different platforms only to lose the dodgy momentum to actually see them through. Whether it was the overwhelming task of conceptualizing a cohesive theme or the frustration of fine-tuning the interface aesthetic, I simply couldnâ€™t muster the patience. Yet here I am, still impatient as ever,  but with just enough nonchalance to see this through. It is long overdue, really. I've put up the same New Year's Eve goal for a handful of years already. But this time feels different, nice, if I name it myself - creating my first post on my very own blog.

My reason for creating a blog is simple: I want to blog for the sake of blogging. Tautological but it is what it is. That is the core of it.

But if I think seriously and hard, it is because I am strongly impelled to leave something behind and to pen every reflection and thought about science and life and the wonderful things in between. And I tend to tire really quickly if I have to speak for long durations so I thought blogging would be a great way to share my ideas. That being said, now is as good a time as any to warn you: my writing is rusty, my ideas are rough around the edges, and I still need a bit of sharpening up really. But I am really hopeful that blogging (and publishing publicly) would help by holding me accountable for the quality of my thoughts and the way I communicate. My hope is that what I write can spark some curiosity in you, perhaps even inspire a few questions or two or initiate a passionate disagreement. Afterall, life (in a scientific and everyday sense) is such an astounding feature of the universe - and you just can't not be intrigued by the stems and gears that drive it. There's always something worth pondering about how all of this works.

Anyway, this is becoming too long for an intro. But my intentions and motivations should be clear enough. I apologize for the layout and the overall look- it's still a work in progress. Thanks for reaching this part of the post!

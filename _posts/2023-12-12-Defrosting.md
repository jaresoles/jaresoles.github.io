Let me address the elephant in the room that despite its humungous size is very unlikely to get cancer.

I cannot believe that it took me a year before I finally made a new post. I have been holding my head too low that I sincerely have very little recollection of many improtant things that have changed and happened right before me. And one cannot chronicle what they do not see and live...or think deeply about, at least in my case, who finds writing as an all-consuming activity, that it even depletes the little amount of patience and sociability that I have. While the world is far from not being such a sad sight, Im lucky to have a POV that's slowly and carefully recalibrating to be a little less grim (which honestly seemed like outside of my control) that's helping me to write again. The world is starting to look prettier again with all shades of blue becoming brighter, and yellow becoming warmer on the skin, and green becoming livelier than they used to look. I'm at a point in life where all pens call to be picked up, ukulele strings invite to be strummed, and fun just simply deserves to be had!

I have been feeling a bit more "inspired" than usual and that has given me the drive to start writing things down. I recently went to three scientific gatherings and that really has made the difference. I have material that exists beyond the typical day to day goings on of a labrat. But the challenge of writing remains - I have so many things in my head that want to be said but they get changed in the process of putting them on paper and I just cant get them back! They just look so different that what my mind had initially conceived! Oh well, the point of this blog is to do just that - hone my writing skills.

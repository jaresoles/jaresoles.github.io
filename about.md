I originally planned in making this into an academic-y-ish blog, but have changed direction while I was writing my first text (see: Up and running.). For a short introduction, I am a young scientist who spends most of his time tending to bacteria from guts of one terrestrial organism (human, E. coli) and one marine organism (shipworm, T. turnerae). I am interested with the workings of the shipworm symbiont which enabled a unique ecological niche for the shipworms. As with E. coli,  I am the parasite in this relationship, as I only overwork them to produce proteins that I want to play with.

I am a graduate student in marine science, under the marine biotechnology track. I reside in an archipelagic country that is at the heart of global diversity and I think that already makes the case for why I would pursue marine science- but specifically why biotechnology track is simply because I am interested in understanding physiological complexity at the biomolecular scale. I am currently doing my thesis on the regenerative capacity of sea cucumbers - our earliest metazoan ancestors.

I like to sing, play instruments and games, and go on long walks.

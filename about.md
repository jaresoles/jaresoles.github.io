I originally planned in making this into an academic-y-ish blog, but have changed direction while I was writing my first text (see: Up and running.). For a short introduction, I am a graduate student who spends too much time tending to bacteria from the GI tract of terrestrial organisms (like humans, E. coli) and a marine invertebrate (shipworm, T. turnerae). I also play with Mass Spec and proteins A LOT.

I am taking up my masters in marine science, under the marine biotechnology track. I reside in an archipelagic country that is at the heart (?) of global diversity and I think that already makes the case for why I would pursue marine science- but specifically why biotechnology track is simply because I am interested in understanding physiological complexity at the biomolecular scale. I am doing my thesis on the profiling and (functional characterization of some) neuropeptides of sea cucumbers - our earliest deuterostomian ancestors.

I like to sing, play instruments and games, and go on long walks.

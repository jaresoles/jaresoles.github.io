I originally planned in making this into an academic-y-ish blog, but have changed direction while I was writing my first text (see: Tautological). But for a short introduction, I am a young scientist who spends most of his time tending to bacteria from guts of one terrestrial organism (human, E. coli) and one marine organism (shipworm, T. turnerae). I am interested with the workings of the shipworm symbiont which is a known degrader of wood. As with E. coli,  I am the parasite in this relationship, as I only overwork them to produce proteins that I want to play with.


I am a graduate student in marine science, under the marine biotechnology track. I reside in an archipelagic country and I think that already makes the case for why I would pursue marine science- but specifically why biotechnology track is simply because I am interested at the fine-grained mechanics of all life forms.

I like to sing, play instruments and games, and go on long walks. 


### More Information

2015 to 2019: University of the Philippines Visayas, BS (Biology)
  *2016: I got kicked out of Chemistry class because my instructor caught me playing Mario Kart. I still cringe at that version of myself. 
2019 to 2021: Molecular Genetics Unit, National Institutes of Health, University of the Philippines Manila, Researcher
  *2020:  I did PCR of 72 samples and got no bands. 
2021 to Present: Protein Biochemistry & Biotechnology Laboratory, Marine Science Institute, University of the Philippines Diliman, Researcher	  *2021: It took me weeks before I could get an acceptable calibration curve. My first curve was at an r^2 of .85. 
2021 to Present: MS in Marine Science (Marine Biotechnology)
  *2022: I was able to recombinantly produce a protein!
  *2022: I recently did a PCR of 20 samples and got not one band.
  *2022: Lab currently hosts four undergraduate interns. I have so much fun teaching them a few things about biochemistry and microbiology.

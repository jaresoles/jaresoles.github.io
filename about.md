### Call me Aidan (not Ishmael - I would never hunt whales).

I originally planned in making this into an academic-y-ish blog, but have changed direction while I was writing my first text (see: Up and running.). For a short introduction, I recently graduated with a master's in marine science, under the marine biotechnology track. I reside in an archipelagic country that is at the heart of global diversity and I think that sufficiently makes the case for why I would pursue marine science. But specifically why biotechnology track is simply because I am interested in understanding physiological complexity at the biomolecular scale. I did my master's thesis on the neuropeptides of sea cucumbers - our earliest deuterostomian ancestors. Mass spectrometry (proteomics and a bit of metabolomics), DNA biochemistry, and genomics keep me busy. And also, I love neurons so much.

I like to sing, write, make comics with ugly illustrations, play instruments and games, and go on really long walks. Did I mention I like biomolecules and neurons and living organisms (other than humans and model organisms)?

### Call me Aidan

I originally planned in making this into an academic-y-ish blog, but have changed direction while I was writing my first text (see: Tautological). But for a short introduction, I am a young scientist who spends most of his time tending to bacteria from guts of one terrestrial organism (human, E. coli) and one marine organism (shipworm, T. turnerae). I am interested with the workings of the shipworm symbiont which is a known degrader of wood. As with E. coli,  I am the parasite in this relationship, as I only overwork them to produce proteins that I want to play with.


I am a graduate student in marine science, under the marine biotechnology track. I reside in an archipelagic country and I think that already makes the case for why I would pursue marine science- but specifically why biotechnology track is simply because I am interested at the fine-grained mechanics of all life forms.

I like to sing, play instruments and games, and go on long walks.
